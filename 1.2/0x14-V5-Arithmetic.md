# V5: Arithmetic

## Control Objective

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high-level requirements:
* All mathematical operations and extreme variable values are handled in a safe and predictable manner.

Category “V5” lists requirements related to the arithmetic operations of the smart contracts.

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **5.1** | Verify that the values and math operations are resistant to integer overflows. Use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations before solidity 0.8.*. | 
| **5.2** | Verify that the unchecked code snippets from Solidity 0.8.* do not introduce integer under/overflows. | 
| **5.3** | Verify that the extreme values (e.g. maximum and minimum values of the variable type) are considered and do not change the logic flow of the contract. | 
| **5.4** | Verify that non-strict inequality is used for balance equality. | 
| **5.5** | Verify that there is a correct order of magnitude in the calculations. | 
| **5.6** | Verify that in calculations, multiplication is performed before division for accuracy. | 
| **5.7** | Verify that there are no vulnerabilities associated with arithmetics. |
