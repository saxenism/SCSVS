# V6: Malicious input handling

## Control Objective

Values obtained as parameters by smart contracts should be validated.

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high-level requirements:
* The function parameters being passed are handled in a safe and predictable manner.

Category “V6” lists requirements related to the malicious input to the functions of smart contracts.

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **6.1** | Verify that if the input (function parameters) is validated, the positive validation approach (allowlisting) is used where possible. |
| **6.2** | Verify that the length of the string literal being passed is determined and validated by smart contract. |
| **6.3** | Verify that there are no vulnerabilities associated with malicious input handling. |
